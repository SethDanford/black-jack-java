# My Black Jack Java game, what is it?
This is a project that I did as a part of my uni degree for a class called Further Programming.
This game is a lot like balck jack exept for a few things, the details of which are listed below.

# Rules and other details
- The goal of the game is to get as close to 42 as possible.
- If you go over 42, your final card is not couted in your score. In other words, your bust card is not counted thus leaving you with a score below 42.
- You get the cards you are delt, you do not get to choose when to stop receiving cards and you do not get to fold, making this a purely luck based game.
- If your score is lower than the house score you loose your bet.
- If your score is the same as the house you get your credits back.
- If your score is higher than the house you win the amount of credits that you bet.

# How do I play?
- To add a play click on the add player button. When prompted enter a unique ID, any name and any amount of points (non-negative). You can select different players by using the dropdown menu at the top of the window.
- You must bet before you can be delt. So press the bet button and enter a bet.
- Once all of the players have bet and been delt, the house will be automatically delt.
- Details of weather a player wins or losses will be show on the same line as the players name, displayed in the top part of the screen. A players points will be updated automatically.
